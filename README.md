**Bus Simulation(Computer Graphics Project)**
A 3D animated bus simulation built using OpenGL and GLUT, simulating a smart transportation scene complete with animated buses, passengers, bus stops, roads, and environment elements.

**Project Objective**

To simulate a realistic, interactive 3D environment representing a smart bus stop, including:

  -3D modeled buses and stop structures
  -Animated character interactions (boarding/dropping)
  -Keyboard-controlled simulation  
  -Real-time text-based instructions

**Key Features**

  -3D Modeling & Rendering: Realistic models of buses, shelters, benches, lamp posts, trees, and people.
  -Animations: Smooth bus movement, character pick-up and drop, timed visual transitions.
  -User Interaction: Control movement with arrow keys, triggering events like boarding or parking.
  -Text Rendering: Live instructions using GLUT fonts for immersive feedback.
  -Scene Switching: Multi-stage animation flow (pickup, drive, drop-off).
